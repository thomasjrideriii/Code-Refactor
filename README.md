# UNC-Bootcamp-HW1
First Week Homework for UNC Bootcamp


* I streamlined the css code by simplifying some of the extranious tags in the html, and combining codes in the css to take up less lines of code.  In simplifying classes and ids I was able to fix the links in the nav bar.  I also added a few styling effects to the floating elements, and attempted to make them able to scale with the browser.  Alt tags were added to each image, and the h" tags were reorganized to better reflect positions in the page.
